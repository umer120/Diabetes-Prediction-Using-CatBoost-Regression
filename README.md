# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-CatBoost-Regression

This repository contains an Artificial Intelligence term project focused on predicting diabetes using CatBoost Regression. The project applies machine learning techniques to a publicly available Diabetes Prediction dataset, emphasizing exploratory data analysis (EDA), advanced data visualizations, and model performance evaluation.

The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature analysis, model training using CatBoost, hyperparameter tuning, and result interpretation using appropriate evaluation metrics. The objective of this project is to demonstrate a practical understanding of machine learning concepts and the effective application of CatBoost Regression to solve a real-world healthcare problem.
